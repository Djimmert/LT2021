E.g. questions that start with *which*, *when*, where the property is expressed by a verb, etc.\n","* Apart from the techniques introduced last week (matching tokens on the basis of their lemma or part-of-speech), also include at least one pattern where you use the dependency relations to find the relevant property or entity in the question. \n","* Include 10 examples of questions that your system can handle, and that illustrate the fact that you cover additional question types\n","\n","## Examples\n","\n","Here is a non-representative list of questios and question types to consider.

Solving this problem was done by looking at all questions (from 'Test Questions') about duration and extracting all formulations. String matching turned out to be the best solution: phrases such as 'how long' and 'how many minutes' are then directly translated to having the property 'duration'. Since this seems like a simple solution, I added an additional type of question handled below:\n","\n","3.   **Questions that are asked in a specific passive form**\n","\n","      This entails questions of the form *'Which [movies]  are [directed] by X?'*. Interestingly, for such a question, the challenge is not only to find the right spans for the entity and property, but also to reformulate the query to accomodate searching 'in reverse' (i.e. not using movie titles, but looking for them).\n","\n","\n","Listed below are 10 example questions that the new system can answer.\n","\n","1.

Examples 7 and 8 illustrate the *'Who is the X of Y?'*-questions are still handled. Examples 1, 2 and 9 illustrate how the verb can denote the role (extra question type 1 above). Examples 4 and 5 illustrate how asking for movie duration can function (extra question type 2). Examples 3, 6 and 10 show how the passive construction (extra question type 3) can be used.
